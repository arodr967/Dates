 Description:  
    Accept the validated dates in month/day/year format and convert
    each of them to the day, abbreviated month & year format 
    (i.e. 1 JAN 1990). The abbreviated month consist of the first
    three letters of the month, capitalized.
 
    The converted results will be redirected to the output file 
    (output.dat), followed by a copy of the original (dates.dat) data.
